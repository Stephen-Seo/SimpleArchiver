# Simple Archiver

This program exists because I could not get `tar` or `ar` to compile with
[Cosmopolitan](https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html). Thus, this
archiver will be written with support for Cosmopolitan in mind. This means
sticking to the C programming language and possibly using Cosmopolitan-specfic
API calls.
