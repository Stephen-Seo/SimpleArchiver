# Simple Archiver

This program ~~is not yet~~ almost finished! Basic functionality is implemented
and only some advanced features are missing. You can track progress
[here](https://git.seodisparate.com/stephenseo/SimpleArchiver/projects/3).

This program exists because I could not get `tar` or `ar` to compile with
[Cosmopolitan](https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html). Thus, this
archiver will be written with support for Cosmopolitan in mind. This means
sticking to the C programming language and possibly using Cosmopolitan-specfic
API calls.
